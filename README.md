### About

Quick-Pick is a job portal website for anyone who needs a second job, are unable to work on a fixed schedule, or simply have a limit on their availability.

Our dream is to help everyone find meaningful and fulfilling employment. Quick-Pick will verify a userâ€™s identity to help match them with a job, and then they can create their own job listing creating a level of trust between our websites and employers.

The website tracks availability to match the seekers and employers, and checks qualifications and skills. Once the connection is made, the seeker and employer can easily communicate to find the best shifts and schedule based on their needs.
